I liked Stella Maris quite a bit more than The Passenger. The format, consisting exclusively of dialogue between Alicia and a psychologist, takes some getting used to but I found to be easy to follow after a chapter or two. I also enjoyed getting a better look into the mind of Alicia, who only partially described throughout The Passenger.

It's not often a book makes me feel unintelligent though, and this one certainly did. Some reviews I read described it as self-indulgent, and others described it as an intellectual masterpiece. I'm not sure I can really judge which it is, but I definitely found it to be an interesting and compelling read.
