I read this book with a friend, and found it to be a really excellent and thorough exploration of a semi-hidden issue in today's society. The first half details ways one can individually improve focus, and the second half explores the web of systemic problems contributing of this degradation in attention-span. I found Hari's conclusion to be especially motivational, as he points out that we need to be able to focus on something for more than a few minutes at a time to be able to solve the complex problems the world presents today.
