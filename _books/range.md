For some reason, I struggled to get past the opening chapter of this book a few times. However, after a glowing recommendation from a coworker, I chose to push through and finish *Range*. It was a well-written argument for multidisciplinary people and multidisciplinary work in the modern world, and I found it helpful for my current position, when I am trying to decide how and whether I want to specialize in my career. Epstein's advice is to focus not on how you can achieve a goal that's twenty years away, but rather to consider the options currently available to you, and decide which will bring you the most growth.
