I read *The Coddling of the American Mind* in 2020, and I was excited to hear about Haidt's update to the issues discussed in both works. The ideas presented in *The Anxious Generation*  square with the observations my friends, family, and I have had about Gen Z over the last several years. I like how Haidt presents the issue, not seeking to blame anyone for the problems at hand (except tech companies seeking to mine the attention of minors), but still imploring parents, schools, and regulators to work together to address the variety of ways in which our children are being held back from their potential as human beings.
