This was the second book by Backman I've read. After getting used to his style of writing, which switches subjects and plotlines a lot, it became very easy to enjoy the story and feel deeply connected to the characters he creates. I read a few weeks ago that reading fiction is an excellent way of practicing and building empathy--books like that really make that feel true.
