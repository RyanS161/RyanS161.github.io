## Leadership Coursework

#### PRLC 1810: Leadership Foundations and Applications I

PRLC 1810 is the Presidents Leadership Class's first-year lecture, focusing on introductions to leadership theory and skills. In this class, I explored my leadership development and what brought me to CU and PLC through an assigned essay named "Who Am I?". With a team of my peers, I explored different leadership theories and styles, giving a presentation on eLeadership midway through the semester. Despite being held entirely online, this class brought me closer to the community within my PLC cohort, taught me about my existing strengths in leadership and academics, and gave me the opportunity to refine my presenting and writing skills.

#### PRLC 1820: Leadership Foundations and Applications II

In the second half of the PLC first-year lecture, we focused more on the application side of leadership, covering six different focus areas throughout the semester. My group was in charge of teaching about leadership in the health sector, and so we gave presentation outlining some of the failures and success in managing the COVID-19 pandemic (a particularly relevant topic in the spring of 2021). For this team-teach, we needed an interactive element, so with the guidance of my teammates, I coded an interactive simulation to illustrate the importance of making good choices early in a crisis. This course taught me more about what it means to be a leader in context, and how I can use my strengths to help others.

#### ENLP 3100: Complex Leadership Challenges

In Complex Leadership Challenges, students each pick a topic that they find interesting or important, and attempt to explore fully the nuances of that topic over the course of the semester. Though I didn't know it at the time, it was a perfect introduction to systems thinking and systems leadership. I chose to focus on fast-fashion in the outdoor industry, and learned a lot about the environmental and economic problems that come with manufacturing and selling clothing that needs to be highly performant. I also went on a small tangent midsemester, exploring the need humans feel to separate and insulate themselves from their environments using high-tech gear. This class taught me to think critically, improved my writing skills immensely, and gave me the tools to better research and learn about systems before attempting to intervene.

#### PRLC 3810: Global Issues in Leadership

PRLC 3810 was PLC's global leadership class, where we explored six global issues throughout the course of the semester, with roundtable discussions, guest lecturers, and team-teaches for each topic. My group presented on tensions between China and Taiwan, and how these could affect the citizens of each nation and the global economy. My favorite part of this class was the fact that for each issue, every student was required to write memo detailing their opinions, and to send it to some decision maker. The highlight of that semester for me was when I got a very kind and thoughtful response from the Director of Provenance at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts. The class, and those assignments in particular, taught me that it's worth trying to make change in the world, because there are people listening to what you have to say.
