Hi there! My name is Ryan, and I'm currently pursuing my MS in Robotics, Systems and Controls at ETH Zürich. I'm taking courses across a variety of robotics topics, focusing on perception and learning. 

I graduated from the University of Colorado Boulder, where I studied Computer Science and completed my Senior Thesis in the [Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group](https://arpg.github.io/). I was also involved with the Presidents Leadership Class, and the Engineering Leadership Program, where I was a Fellow.

I've also had the pleasure of work on robots outside of the academic setting. I spent a summer at [Outrider](https://www.outrider.ai/) working on firmware and test processes for autonomous yard trucks. Before that, I interned at Company Six, working on mobile robots built for first responders. 

Outside of university and work, I love all sorts of endurance and outdoor sports, from road and trail running to cycling to bouldering.

I love developing my skills in robotics and engineering, and if there's a project I can help you with, I'd love to hear from you. Take a look at my resume and my experience to learn more, and feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Thanks for visiting!
