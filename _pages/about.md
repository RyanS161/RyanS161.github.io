My name is Ryan, and I'm a fourth-year engineering student at the University of Colorado Boulder. I am majoring in Computer Science and minoring in Leadership Studies, with an additional certificate in Engineering Leadership.


At CU, I am currently working on my Senior Thesis under Dr. Christoffer Heckman in the [Autonomous Robotics and Perception Group](https://arpg.github.io/). I'm also involved with the Presidents Leadership Class, and the Engineering Leadership Program, where I am a fellow. I have also worked as a Teaching Assistant in engineering and computer science.

Recently I spent a year at [Company Six](https://www.co6.com/) working on software for autonomous robots for first responders. I also spent a summer at [Outrider](https://www.outrider.ai/) working on firmware and test processes for autonomous yard trucks.

I'm excited to be learning more about robotics and engineering, and if there's a project I can help you with, I'd love to hear from you. Take a look at my resume and my experience to learn more, and feel free to connect with me on LinkedIn. Thanks for visiting!
