##### February 2025 - June 2025
<!-- ###### [Report]() | [Poster]() -->


For my first project class at ETH, Perception and Learning for Robotics, my partner and I worked on developing a model for semantic and elevation Birds-Eye-View (BEV) mapping. The model was meant to serve as a benchmark for the recently created dataset [TartanGround](https://tartanair.org/tartanground/index.html).

I will update this page when we are cleared to share the details of our project!
